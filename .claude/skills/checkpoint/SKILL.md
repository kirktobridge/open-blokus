description: Session-end closeout — verify no dangling state (backlog statuses match reality, working tree clean, no orphan scripts), make the checkpoint commits, and write .claude/HANDOFF.md so the next session resumes cheaply. Use for "wrap up", "end session", "checkpoint", "close out", or /checkpoint.

# Checkpoint — session closeout & handoff

A session may end only when: (a) every backlog `Status:` matches reality, (b) the
working tree is clean, (c) `HANDOFF.md` says what's next. This skill enforces that.
It is the **sole writer of `.claude/HANDOFF.md`** (local-only — HANDOFF is
gitignored by design; it's session state, not project history). Sessions run in
parallel on different branches, so HANDOFF is **sectioned per branch**: rewrite only
the current branch's section, never another session's.

## Checks (fix or surface each hit — don't silently pass)
1. `git status --short` — uncommitted changes? Group them into checkpoint commits
   (below). Untracked files under `scripts/` or `src/` are a red flag: either commit
   them with their feature/run or ask.
2. `grep -n "Status:" docs/research/backlog/*.md | grep -i active` — any `active`
   entry must have a matching run in `log/` (check via
   `grep "^### Run" docs/research/log/*.md | tail`). Dangling → tell the user the
   loop is open; /research closes it, not this skill. Also
   `grep -n "Deploys as:" docs/research/backlog/*.md` — a `won` entry whose
   `Deploys as:` points at a product item that doesn't exist yet (or one still
   `proposed` with nothing queued) is a closed-but-undeployed win; surface it.
3. `grep -n "Status:" docs/product/BACKLOG.md | grep -i in-progress` — an
   in-progress entry whose work is **already merged to main** is missing its /ship
   flip; run /ship now (on main). Work that's finished but still on its branch is
   fine — mark the branch **ready to land** in its HANDOFF section and point the
   user at /land; the flip happens there, not here.
4. `## Next up` staleness (product P22) — the P21 schema test already fails CI on a
   dangling/terminal queue, so a green `npm test` covers it; if a feature shipped this
   session, confirm /ship refreshed the head.
5. `git branch --no-merged main` — every unmerged branch should have a HANDOFF
   section saying whether it's ready to land or what blocks it. A branch with no
   section is an unknown — flag it to the user. Landing is **/land**'s job, not
   this skill's; just report which branches are ready.

## Checkpoint commits (tied to completions, never time)
One commit per completed unit, code and docs separate:

| Completed unit | Commit shape |
|---|---|
| implementation + tests green | `feat:` / `fix:` / `perf:` |
| a /research record + close | `research(<ID>): <question> — <decision>` (log + FINDINGS + status + `scripts/experiments/` config together) |
| a /ship doc sync | `docs: ...` |

Don't bundle unrelated units; don't commit with failing tests without saying so in
the message and to the user.

## HANDOFF.md (one section per in-flight branch — a baton rack, not a log)
`.claude/HANDOFF.md` holds one `##` section per unmerged branch. Rewrite **only the
current branch's section** (a few lines each); leave other sections untouched —
parallel sessions own those. Prune sections whose branch is merged into main or
deleted.

```markdown
# Handoff

## <branch> — <date>
- **Changed:** <what landed this session, with commit shas>
- **In flight:** <open loops: active experiments, half-done features, failing tests + why>
- **Next:** <the single most likely next action, with its backlog ID>
- **Land:** ready | blocked on <what>
```

**Next session's entry path:** read HANDOFF.md, then orient with the Phase-0 grep
from /research — not by re-reading the tree.

## Not this skill
- Closing a research loop → **/research**. Doc sync → **/ship**. Merging a
  finished branch into main → **/land**. This skill only verifies they ran,
  commits, and writes the baton.
