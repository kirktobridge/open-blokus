# Land — merge a finished branch into main

One branch per invocation. This is the **only skill that merges**; /checkpoint
surfaces what's ready to land, this skill does the landing. It writes no docs
itself — /ship, invoked as the last step, is the pen.

Runs **forked** (`context: fork`) so the merge/test churn never lands in the main
session's context. Consequences: everything needed must come from git + HANDOFF (it
does — don't rely on conversation state), and the main session sees **only your
final message** — end with a compact report: merge sha, test totals, doc flips
made, branch deleted or not, and on failure *exactly* what failed and what state
main was left in.

## Preconditions (stop if any fail)
- Working tree clean (`git status --short`).
- The branch's section in `.claude/HANDOFF.md` says **ready to land** — or the user
  explicitly says land it anyway. No section → run /checkpoint on that branch first.
- Tests were green at the branch's checkpoint; if in doubt, re-run on the branch.

## Steps
1. `git checkout main` (pull first if there's a remote), then
   `git merge --no-ff <branch>` — keeps the existing merge-commit convention.
2. **Conflicts → stop and show them.** Never auto-resolve silently. With the
   flips-on-main discipline (see /ship) doc conflicts should be rare, so a conflict
   is a signal something skipped the process — say so.
3. Verify the merged result: `npm test` (vitest **and** Playwright, always both) +
   `npm run typecheck`, wrapped in `time`. Red → undo the merge
   (`git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD`), report what failed, and leave main untouched —
   never leave main broken.
4. Run **/ship** on main: terminal status flip, `## Next up` refresh, any
   BUILD_ORDER / ARCHITECTURE touch-up. For a research branch, check the `AE#`/`AD#`
   loop is closed (`Status` terminal + `Log:` linked) — that's /research's file;
   bounce there if it isn't. If the branch changes a shipped AI default (difficulty
   tiers, mcts defaults), check the backing finding's confidence label — landing on
   a `replication-pending` finding is allowed but must be named in the final report.
5. Delete the branch (`git branch -d`). Its HANDOFF section is pruned by the next
   /checkpoint (sole writer of HANDOFF), not here.

## Not this skill
- Doc edits → **/ship** (invoked as step 4, never replaced). Research docs → **/research**.
- Session closeout / writing HANDOFF → **/checkpoint**.
- Building the feature → **/implement**.
